          I was hit with a surprise divorce petition which cast me in the most
          negative matter in order to gain assets and possible maintenance from
          me. I'm glad I chose Ms. Jacqueline Kriebel. She was upfront,
          communicative, responsive, and professional throughout. She was able
          to give genuine advice which helped me get through this legal process
          with minimal stress and loss to my present and future assets. I'll
          always be grateful. I give Ms. Kriebel my highest recommendation. -

          My husband and I were seeking an attorney who was reasonable and
          efficient. We agreed on most issues and just had a couple legal
          questions regarding property division. I don't really trust attorneys
          and was unsure how to go about hiring one my husband and I could trust
          not to take us for a ride. I found Jacqueline Kriebel on avvo.com and
          saw her amazing reviews. Her clients are right about her. When I
          called she personally answered. I was expecting to speak to an
          assistant and not the attorney herself. I was impressed immediately!
          Jacqueline answered my questions patiently and made me feel at ease
          right away. My husband and I didn't want to drag out our divorce.
          Jacqueline filed our paperwork and finalized just past the 60-day
          waiting period. Our divorce was quick, easy, and legally painless. If
          you need someone who will truly do a reasonable and quick divorce, I
          HIGHLY RECOMMEND Jacqueline Kriebel! - Divorce client (5-star review)

          I'm 62 years old and have had many attorneys over the past 62 years of
          my life. I have had BAD experiences with attorneys until I met Ms.
          Kriebel. Jacqueline kept us informed with all that was going on it our
          case. She was right up front about the outcome and fought our rights.
          Whenever we called and could not talk to her she would always return
          our calls. All I can say is that she is GREAT!!!! She is a asset to
          the legal profession!! If I ever need an attorney you can bet she will
          be the one that I call. Jacqueline Kriebel WON our case and we want to
          say THANK YOU very much. - Roy, a Child Custody client (5-star review)

          Jacqueline Kriebel is a Superstar family attorney. She took all the
          correct legal steps to bring a quick and favorable resolution to my
          case in the absence of a mutual agreement. She communicated with me
          efficiently and provided legal guidance every step of the way. She is
          very knowledgeable and professional. She addressed issues in court as
          they arose effectively. I am very pleased with her overall service. -
