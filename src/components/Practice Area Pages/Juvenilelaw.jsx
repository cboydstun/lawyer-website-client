            Juvenile law recognizes that young individuals should be treated
            differently from adults within the legal system. The focus of the
            juvenile justice system is on rehabilitation, aiming to ensure that
            early mistakes do not unduly impact a youth's future. At Kriebel Law
            Firm, PLLC, I represent minors in San Antonio and throughout Texas
            who face criminal charges, advocating for outcomes that prioritize
            your child's long-term well-being.

          Parentsâ€™ primary concern is often the safety of their children. When
          young people confront criminal charges, obtaining skilled legal
          counsel experienced in juvenile law is crucial. I leverage my
          extensive background to deliver a robust defense for juveniles

          Juvenile court judges have various options when addressing cases
          before them. While they must balance the needs of the young offender
          with public safety, they are generally inclined to recommend probation
          and treatment programs over confinement. My experience allows me to
          anticipate how local judges and juvenile courts are likely to handle
          your child's case, enabling me to effectively represent their rights
          and pursue the most favorable outcome.

          If your child is accused of, charged with, or under investigation for
          a criminal offense, swift action is essential. Delays can jeopardize
          valuable legal advantages and your child's future. I am committed to

          My comprehensive understanding of juvenile law equips me to navigate

          In addition to representing juveniles accused of misconduct, I also
          advocate for youth involved in abuse and neglect cases, where they may
          be at risk from a parent or guardian. The state may intervene to
          protect these vulnerable individuals, appointing attorneys to act as
          guardians ad litem and represent their best interests.

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-6">
          If a young person is deemed at risk, courts may provide rehabilitative
          programs for families or, in severe cases, terminate parental rights.
          I fight vigorously for the rights and safety of juveniles, ensuring
          they receive the protection they deserve.
